# NGHL (New Gauge Half Life)
Now your Half Life speedrun client is in Mac OS X!
Built on Afflux.'s Wineskin base. You can speedrun to your hearts desire!

# What is NGHL?
NGHL is a Half-Life client designed for speedrunning by rofi. Used by every famous Half Life speedrunner.
It wasn't available (it was on SourceRuns but its dead) for Mac/Linux so I ported it to Mac (sorry linux gamers.)
The version that now you download is the Full version of NGHL, there is also Lite version, which maybe i will port too!
Port was designed also for Mac speedrunners, which now you can say goodbye to vanilla Steam HL.

# What is Half Life?

Game where the guy named Gordon just makes a portal to some alien world and now he is saving the world.
Just search it up.

# The resolution is low.
Um yeah, about that you can change the configuration in Wineskin by going in into the files and double click Wineskin, click Set Screen Options and just do it from there, and then change the resolution in the game itself to your resolution that you chose.

# Steam in the start?

When opening the game, its just me testing some stuff. Dont worry bout that.
You don't need Steam for the game to load.

# Lite version?

Coming soon.

# HL2 logo?

Yep. Pretty much everything as i said is built in Afflux's Half Life 2 for Mac wineskin.

# What about the FPS? Is it affected by the Mac I'm using?

Tested in a iMac 2009. macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra.
FPS is at max 60. The only framerates it can reach
